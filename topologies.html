            <h1>Topologies</h1>
            <p>For low power, half bridge resonant converters are widely used and controllers are commercially available.  The full-bridge DC-DC converter is my starting point because it is capable of high power operating and often requires custom controller design.</p>
            <p>The simplest resonant topology is the SRC Buck Converter.  While the half-bridge is widely used at low power levels, the full bridge is the starting point for high power converters</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>The converter in Fig. 1 is capable of buck and boost mode.  If only buck mode is needed in the application, the IGBTs in the output bridge would wisely be replaced with diodes.</p>

            <h1>Current Flow</h1>
            <p>Starting with buck mode in Fig. 2a, power flows from Vi to Vo.  Since current is polarity symmetrical, it is sufficient to discuss iL > 0A. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Since current is polarity symmetrical, it is sufficient to discuss iL > 0A.  Input bridge devices LU and RL turn on at the zero crossing of iL.  This causes tank current to rise in the transformer and to the load via the output bridge rectifiers.
                As current reaches a level set by the regulator, RL turns off causing the current to flow through the RU diode as shown in Fig 2(a2).  Eventually, iL returns to 0A and the negative cycle of iL can begin.
            </p>
            <p>Buck mode operation is very efficient because the tank current RMS and rectified load current are the same.  Plus, the input bridge devices are either in ZVS or ZCS.</p>
            <p>The ratio of Vi/Vo needs to be well greater than 1 in order to have high power flow.  If the ratio is too close to 1, the tank current is too low even at resonance.  For this reason, reduced boost mode is shown in Fig. 2b as a means to increase tank current.  Reduced boost mode simply shorts the output bridge to incease the tank current rapidly before transfering current to the load.</p>
            <p>To avoid abrupt discontinuity from buck to boost mode, reduced boost mode gradually extends the short-circuit time.  Short circuit time increases from 0 to full as Vi/Vo decreases from 1.25 to 1 at which point the circuit is in full boost mode.</p>
